Provides drag and drop functionality to the TileList AS3 component.

Each instance of dd\_tile\_list can be configured several ways but generally is meant to provide for pool and collection instances where the pool type provides a set of cells to choose from and the collection type receives drops from the pool.

Re-ordering within a tile list is supported.

It seemed that this project didn't get created so I made another one.
